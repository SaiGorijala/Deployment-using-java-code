# **Java EE Application Deployment Guide: Build Server to Deploy Server Workflow**

# **1. Project Context and Goal**

This guide details the process of creating, building, and deploying the classic JBoss/WildFly **"Member Registration"** quickstart application (the one shown in your screenshot) using a two-basic server model with minimal instance setup: a dedicated **Build Server** and a dedicated **Deployment Server**.

| Server           | Role                                  | Key<br>Components                    |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Build<br>Server  | Compiles<br>source<br>code,<br>runs   | JDK,<br>Apache<br>Maven,<br>Git      |
|                  | tests,<br>and<br>produces<br>the      |                                      |
|                  | deployable<br>artifact<br>(.war).     |                                      |
| Deploy<br>Server | Hosts<br>the<br>application<br>server | JDK,<br>WildFly/JBoss<br>Application |
|                  | (WildFly/JBoss)<br>and<br>runs<br>the | Server                               |
|                  | application.                          |                                      |

Basic Ubuntu server with a t3.micro instance type

{1}------------------------------------------------

This is the final instance setup

# **2. Prerequisites and Environment Setup**

Ensure the following tools are installed on both servers (or your local machine, if simulating servers using different directories/ports).Make sure that before installing the tools update the servers using command

```
``` sudo apt -y update ```
```

## **Prerequisites (Both Servers)**

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or newer):** Must be installed in build server and configured correctly.

2. **Maven:** should also be installed in the build server only once the compatible java version is installed so that maven wen installs configures its settup according

4. **Networking:** Ensure both servers can communicate on the necessary ports (typically port 8080 for HTTP access).

## **Setting up the Servers (Logical Separation)**

To simulate the two-server environment on a single machine (if required), follow these steps:

- 1. **Define Server Directories:**
  - **Build Server Directory:** ~/javaee-build-server/
  - **Deploy Server Directory:** ~/wildfly-deploy-server/ (This is where you extract the WildFly/JBoss zip file).
- 2. **Run Deploy Server (WildFly):** Start the application server on the Deploy Server. We will use the default standalone.xml configuration.
  - # On the Deploy Server machine (or inside the extracted WildFly directory)
  - \$ cd ~/wildfly-deploy-server/bin
  - \$ ./standalone.sh

# **3. Project Creation and Build (On Build Server)**

All steps in this section are performed exclusively on the **Build Server**.

## **Step 3.1: Get the Project Source Code**

The project is based on the famous JBoss "kitchensink" quickstart. It can be initialized via Maven or cloned directly. We will clone a common repository structure.

# 1. Navigate to the Build Server directory

\$ cd ~/javaee-build-server/

{4}------------------------------------------------

# 2. Clone the representative quickstart project \$git clone

[https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-as-quickstarts.git\$](https://github.com/jboss-devel oper/jboss-as-quickstarts.git\$) cd jboss-as-quickstarts/kitchensink

### **Step 3.2: Configure and Inspect the Project**

The project is a standard Java EE 6 application that uses JPA (for data), Bean Validation (for constraints), JAX-RS (for a REST API), and JSF/Facelets (for the web UI).

#### ‚óè **Key Files:**

- src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/model/Member.java: Contains the JPA entity with Bean Validation annotations (e.g., @NotNull, @Size, @Email).
- src/main/resources/import.sql: Used by JPA (Hibernate) to populate initial data, including the "John Smith" record visible in the screenshot.
- src/main/webapp/index.xhtml: The JSF/Facelets view containing the registration form and member list.

#### **Step 3.3: Build the Artifact (.war file)**

Use Apache Maven to compile the source code, run any unit tests, and package the final deployable artifact.

# On the Build Server

\$ mvn clean package

#### Output:

{5}------------------------------------------------

# **4. Transfer and Deployment (To Deploy Server)**

This is the critical step where the built artifact is moved from the Build Server to the Deploy Server.

### **Step 4.1: Transfer the Artifact**

We will use the **Secure Copy Protocol (scp)** as a standard, secure way to transfer the file across a network. This command needs to be executed on the **Build Server**.

#### **Assumptions:**

- **Deploy Server IP:** 192.168.1.100 (Replace with the actual IP address of your Deploy Server).
- **Deploy Server User:** deploy\_user
- **Deployment Directory Path:** The folder that WildFly/JBoss constantly monitors for new application files is standalone/deployments/.
- **On the Build Server**

First get your pem file to build server from local machine

Than transfer the build file from the build server to the deploy server using scp -i

{6}------------------------------------------------

#### **Step 4.2: Automatic Deployment on Deploy Server**

As soon as the kitchensink.war file is successfully placed into the standalone/deployments/ folder on the Deploy Server, **WildFly/JBoss detects the new file and automatically attempts to deploy it.**

In the WildFly console (the terminal where you ran ./standalone.sh), you will see log messages confirming the deployment:

[org.jboss.as.server] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 29) WFLYSRV0010: Deployed "kitchensink.war" (runtime-name : "kitchensink.war")

If the deployment is successful, WildFly creates a marker file named kitchensink.war.deployed.

# **5. Verification**

To verify that the deployment was successful and matches your screenshot, open a web browser and navigate to the Deploy Server's IP address and the application's context root.

#### 1. **Access URL:**

http://<DEPLOY\_SERVER\_IP>:8080/kitchensink/

- (Replace <DEPLOY\_SERVER\_IP> with localhost if running on the same machine, or the actual IP address otherwise).
- 2. Expected Output:

You will see the Member Registration page, which includes the section:

- **Register (Bean Validation example)**
- A form to register a new member.
- A list displaying the initial data from import.sql (e.g., **John Smith**).

The successful display of this page confirms that:

- The Build Server successfully compiled the artifact.
- The artifact was correctly transferred and deployed to the Deploy Server.
- All Java EE components (CDI, JPA, Bean Validation, JAX-RS) are running correctly.
